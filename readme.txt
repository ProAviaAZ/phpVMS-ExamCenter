Some Notes:

1 - EXAMCenter Staff Members have the ability to assign & approve exams, author exams and questions, and create revision reasons.
2 - EXAMCenter Administrators have all the abilities that a staff member has plus the ability to open and close the center, add/remove staff members and admins, edit static messages for the EXAMCenter, change the assign/purchase option, and edit revision codes.
3 - The system automatically assigns the pilot with the database id of "1" as the first administrator. DO NOT un-assign this pilot as an admin unless you have at least one more admin assigned, you will not be able to log back into the center as an admin. I am still working on a check that will not let you do this but wanted to get the beta out.
4 - There are two exams already in the database to give some guidance on how things work.
